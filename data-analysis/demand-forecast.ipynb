    "* Storytelling and visualisation of the insights.\n",

    "Exercise **workflow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import dependencies & data (`../data/Historical\\ Product\\ Demand.csv`).\n",
    "* Explore the dataset to assess its quality (nulls, skew, data types).\n",
    "* Explore the dataset to obtain insights related to the production (e.g., unvariate / bivariate analysis).\n",
    "* Explore the dataset as a time-series (min/max dates, seasonality, trends etc.).\n",
    "* Implement / apply a forecast model:\n",
    "    * Theory\n",
    "    * Parameters tuning\n",
    "    * Build/fit & Validation\n",
    "    * Evaluate performance (e.g., forecast accuracy)\n",
